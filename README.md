# road-damage-detection-classification
you can use this code to detect and classify the damages in the images.
 * In this project, We developed an interactive web application aimed to Detect & Classify the images based
 on number of potholes in the images using machine learning.
 * We used CNN algorithm to construct the model which classifies them into good & poor based on number
 of potholes.
 * Tools:- Pycharm, Kaggle, Python, Flask, HTML, CSS.
